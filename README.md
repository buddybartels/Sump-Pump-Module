Sump Pump Monitoring System

This is a project file for a sump pump monitoring system. The idea is that there is an arduino reading data from a set of float switches on the sump pump. These float signals are sent via a nRF2401 2.4Ghz module to the main station. The main station is also controlled by an arduino and is connected to a GSM module which sends text messages out about pump iterations and warnings if certain levels are reached by the sump module.
